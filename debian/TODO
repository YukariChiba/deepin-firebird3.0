* Invent a way to test the build using firebird test suite.
  http://www.firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=devel&sub=qa&id=qmtest_howto

* Patch super server manager not to spit error/success messages to the
  console, but log them in the logs only.
  Also, make it return proper error codes so we can use LSB functions in 
  the init.d script.

  More fbmanager stuff - make it return success only *after* it has 
  created its PID file

  *** TO BE CHECKED FOR FBGUARD

* -super.service - perhaps skip fbguard completely? we have systemd after allâ€¦)
